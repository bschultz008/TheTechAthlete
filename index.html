          <p>
            The realm of Data Analytics is not only fundamentally important in
            todays society but it has become one of the consummate skills that
            I hold. Studying and growing in this field has allowed me to share
            stories that data holds and has lead me to learn many Techinical
            skills, Analysis Tools and Programming languages:
            <b>R, Python, SQL, PowerBI, Microsoft SQL Server, Tableau,
              HTML.</b>

          <h2>Tech Support</h2>
          <p>
            Graduating with a BBA in Business Administration has allowed me to
            combine my passions of Technolgy and Business. Gaining nearly 3
            years of experience in Information Technology has helped me grow
            and expand my knowledge in skills in computer software, software
            troubleshooting, hardware troubleshooting and developing critical
            soft skills that have helped me become a leader in all areas of my
            life.

          <p>
            Graduating with a BBA in Business Administration and Minor in
            Coaching have helped me aquire the neccesary coaching and
            leadership skills to change peoples lives. Garnering experience as
            the Assistant Track and Field Coach at the Collegiate level has
            forced me to grow and lead a team to accomplish the goals they
            want.

          <h2>Personal Development</h2>
          <p>
            Personal Development is one of the key factors to living a healthy
            lifestyle. Having the ability to learn anything in this world
            today is the driving force that motivates me to become a better
            person while making other people around me the best version of
            themselves. Over the years I have become very voracious in
            self-learning anything that interest me and those ramifications
            spread out to barbering, sports, computers, human development and
            education.

              This personal project was done to analyze many metrics in the
              Covid-19 data set. I analyzed the death rates per country, city,
              state and many more measurments. The use of Joins, Conditional
              Filters, Subqueries, Temp Tables and visualization Software were
              a big part in sharing data stories with others.

        <h2>QA Analyst/Automation Engineer/Coach</h2>
        <p>
          I spent my early twenties in South Georgia developing foundational skills in the workplace, including software
          and hardware support as well as systems integrity. Over time, I have expanded my expertise to include
          automation testing using Java and Selenium, along with a strong understanding of testing methodologies and
          quality assurance practices. I dedicate much of my time to continuous learning, whether it's mastering
          automation tools, refining my coding skills, or exploring best practices in software quality assurance.
          Outside of work, I value staying active through track and field training, spending quality time with my
          family, and enjoying football games on Sundays.
